# Anki Web Browser

> Previously this was in https://github.com/ssricardo/anki-plugins repository. 

The **Anki Web Browser** is a simple Internet Browser within Anki (as the name suggests).  
It aims to make it easy when you are studying or editing a card and want to look something up on the internet.  
You can also use it to open up your system desktop instead of the embedded browser

For instance, you are studying a foreign language and suddenly there is a word which you haven't properly understood. In such case it's common to shift to the web browser and search for the term there. 
This add-on makes this task smoother.  

Therefore, this addon provides 2 functionalities:  

* Search the selected text in a website
  * Or use one of the _no selection_ options
* Import text and images directly from a website to current card
